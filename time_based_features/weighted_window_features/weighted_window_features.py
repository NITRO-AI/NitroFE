    processing literature, where it is used as one of many windowing
    functions for smoothing values.  Note that convolution with this
    window produces linear interpolation.  It is also known as an
    apodization (which means"removing the foot", i.e. smoothing
    discontinuities at the beginning and end of the sampled signal) or
    tapering function. The Fourier transform of the Bartlett is the product
    of two sinc functions.

     The Blackman window is defined as

    The "exact Blackman" window was designed to null out the third and fourth
    sidelobes, but has discontinuities at the boundaries, resulting in a
    6 dB/oct fall-off.  This window is an approximation of the "exact" window,
    which does not null the sidelobes as well, but is smooth at the edges,
    improving the fall-off rate to 18 dB/oct. [3]_

    "removing the foot", i.e. smoothing discontinuities at the beginning
    and end of the sampled signal) or tapering function. It is known as a
    "near optimal" tapering function, almost as good (by some measures)
    as the Kaiser window.
