    The Absolute Price Oscillator displays the difference between two exponential moving averages,
     of a security's price and is expressed as an absolute value.

    ----------
    dataframe : Union[pd.DataFrame, pd.Series] 
        dataframe containing column values to create feature over
    fast_period : int, optional
        specify decay in terms of span, for the fast moving feature , by default 10
    slow_period : int, optional
        specify decay in terms of span, for the slow moving feature, by default 20
    fast_operation : str, optional
        operation to be performed for the fast moving feature, by default 'mean'
    slow_operation : str, optional
        operation to be performed for the slow moving feature, by default 'mean'
    adjust : bool, optional
        Divide by decaying adjustment factor in beginning periods to account for imbalance in relative weightings (viewing EWMA as a moving average)
        , When adjust=False, the exponentially weighted function is calculated recursively,by default False
    ignore_na : bool, optional
        gnore missing values when calculating weights, by default False
    axis : int, optional
        The axis to use. The value 0 identifies the rows, and 1 identifies the columns, by default 0
    times : str, optional
        Times corresponding to the observations. Must be monotonically increasing and datetime64[ns] dtype, by default None

    """calculate_moving_average_convergence_divergence [summary]

    Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship 
    between two moving averages of a securityâ€™s price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential 
    moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA.

    The result of that calculation is the MACD line. A nine-day EMA of the MACD called the "signal line," 
    is then plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy and sell signals.
