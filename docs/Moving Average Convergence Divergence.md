Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship
between two moving averages of a securityâ€™s price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential
moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA.

The result of that calculation is the MACD line. A nine-day EMA of the MACD called the "signal line,"
is then plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy and sell signals.

$$
Moving \ average \ convergence \ divergence \ (MACD) = Exponential \ moving \ average \ of \ (Absolute \ Price \ Oscillator)
$$

$$
Moving average \ convergence \ divergence \ histogram = (Absolute \ Price \ Oscillator)- (Exponential \ moving \ average \ of \ (Absolute \ Price))
$$
